How to make the ui:
- open file uis.yml in plugin folder
- and you can write you own ui like:
	Modal Ui:
	ExampleModalUi:
		type: 0
		contents:
			title: Ui Title
			content: Example text content!
			button1: Button name
			button2: Button name
		commands:
			button1: %CMD::teleport 0 0 0
			button2: %SM::message
	
	Simple Ui:
	ExampleSimpleUi:
		type: 1
		contents:
			title: Ui Title
			buttons:
				- Button name
				- Button 1
				- Button 2
				- More button
		commands:
			- %CMD::say hello world
			- %SM::hallo {PLAYER}
			- %OPEN::ExampleModalUi

Notes:
- type = Type of ui (Modal Ui: 0, Simple Ui = 1)
- {PLAYER} = Player name
- %CMD:: = command line (not '/')
- %SM:: = send message
- %OPEN:: = open the ui
- You must have a FormAPI plugin to use this plugin!

Good luck!
