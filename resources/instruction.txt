How to make the ui:
- open file uis.yml in plugin folder
- and you can write you own ui like:
	
	Simple Ui:
	ExampleSimpleUi:
		type: 1
		contents:
			title: 'Ui Title'
			buttons:
				- 'Button name'
				- 'Button 1'
				- 'Button 2'
				- 'More button'
		commands:
			- '%CMD::say hello world'
			- '%SM::hallo %PLAYER'
			- '%OPEN::ExampleModalUi'

Notes:
- type = Type of ui (Modal Ui: 0, Simple Ui = 1)
- %PLAYER = Player name
- %PLAYER::l = Player name lowercase
- %PLAYER::u = Player name uppercase
- %CMD:: = command line (not '/')
- %SM:: = send message
- %OPEN:: = open the ui
- You must have a FormAPI plugin to use this plugin!

Good luck!
